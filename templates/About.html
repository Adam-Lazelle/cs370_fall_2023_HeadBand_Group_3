                <p class="question-content">We aim to help everyone learn better and more efficiently by using sensors to read your brain waves to tell us how your learning is going. If your learning isnâ€™t working out, we help you get back on track.</p>
                <p class="question-content">This website is used to help you learn better by showing a video whenever your learning starts to slow down or you hit a mental block such as a difficult question or concept. This helps the brain get reinvigorated to start learning more.</p>
